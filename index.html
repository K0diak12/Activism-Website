  <h2> Are Data breaches common?</h2>
  <p class="according revealable">According to a report by RiskBased Security, in the first half of 2021, there were over 18 billion records exposed
    in 1,767 publicly reported data breaches globally. That's equivalent to around 94 million records being compromised
    every day, or over 1,000 records being breached every second!</p>

  <h2>Number Of Data Breaches And Individuals Impacted, 2016-2022 </h2>
  <img src="img/Screenshot (306).png"
  <p>Young people are at a higher risk of being affected by identity theft and other forms of data breaches due to their frequent use of social media and online platforms. It is important for teens and their parents to take steps to protect their personal information online and monitor their digital footprints to avoid becoming victims of cybercrime.</p>
